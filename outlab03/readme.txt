Reflection Essay:
Through this lab,
1. We enjoyed coding this much for the first time! Every task had a charm as to which pokemon were we going to catch this time.
2. Learned how to code up the solutions for problems related with a large numbers of files using shell scripts.
3. Learned how to use regex for finding strings with a particular condition.
4. Learned how to share files via terminal. (File transfer using ncat)
5. Learned how to login to a site using curl.
6. Learned how to get a file type without looking at its extention (which are misleading sometimes)
7. Came to know we can restrict the login to the page to some methods by changing some code at the server side(like the one done in Part D of this Lab)
